# Pablo

Pablo is a lightweight, expressive JavaScript SVG library. Pablo creates interactive drawings with [SVG][svg] (Scalable Vector Graphics), giving access to all of SVG's granularity and power.

Pablo exposes a simple interface to create and manipulate SVG elements and to create complex templates.

Pablo stays lean by targetting the most recent desktop and mobile browsers, and failing gracefully in older browsers.
