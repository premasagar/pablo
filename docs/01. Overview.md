&#8202;<span class="project-name">Pablo</span> is a lightweight, expressive JavaScript library to create interactive drawings with [SVG][svg] (Scalable Vector Graphics).

Pablo exposes a simple interface to create and manipulate SVG elements and complex structures, giving access to all of SVG's granularity and power. The library stays lean by targetting the most recent desktop and mobile browsers, and failing gracefully in older browsers.

It's a bit like a cross between [jQuery][jquery] and [Underscore][_], for SVG. _Example uses:_ low-level, interactive drawing, data visualisation, game canvases, responsive graphics and rich visual interfaces.

Pablo can do anything that SVG can do, in a simple, expressive way.
