&#8202;<span class="project-name">Pablo</span> is a high-performance JavaScript wrapper library for SVG ([scalable vector graphics][svg]). It's a bit like [Raphaël][raphael] plus [jQuery][jquery] plus [Underscore][_]. In just 3KB, with no dependencies.

_Some example uses:_ interactive drawings, data visualisation, games, responsive graphics and rich visual interfaces.

Pablo is low-level, lightweight and expressive. It exposes a simple interface that gives access to all of SVG's granularity and power, creating and manipulating collections of SVG elements. The library stays fast and lean by targetting the most recent desktop and mobile browsers, while failing gracefully elsewhere.

Pablo can create anything that SVG can. It simplifies the task of generating, modifying and interacting with the graphics, and connecting it to the other parts of a JavaScript program.

[See the API Reference][reference] to discover Pablo's extensive API.
