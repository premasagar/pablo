Pablo has an API that will feel familiar to [jQuery][jquery] users (although it isn't important to have prior experience with jQuery). Methods are generally chainable and allow both setting and getting within the same function. Pablo's functionality is centred around array-like collections of DOM elements, much like jQuery's collections. These DOM elements can be SVG or HTML, although Pablo focuses on SVG.

Collections have methods for filtering and manipulating the set of elements, similar to standard JavaScript [arrays][array] and the [Underscore][_] library.

Pablo is designed for the modern desktop and mobile browser. It is a little forgiving and will tell you if the browser [is supported][issupported], but it doesn't go to the extent that jQuery and [Raphaël][raphael] do to work outside the standards to support older browsers. This approach allows Pablo to support the browser's fullest range of SVG capabilities, while remaining lightweight.

Raphaël, for example, supports old versions of Internet Explorer by falling back to the older vector graphics language, [VML][vml], although this restricts Raphaël to the smaller subset of features that both SVG and VML support, and it takes extra library code to do so. Pablo supports all of SVG and is just a thin wrapper around it.

While Pablo takes the lead from these other libraries, it doesn't have any library dependencies itself. It is extendable via plugins, but pablo.js on its own is sufficient for a wide range of graphics tasks.
