Creates a new, named SVG element, with attributes specified as an object, and returns a new collection containg the element:

    Pablo('rect', {x:10, y:10, width:50, height:50});

Here, the attributes object is required, even if it is an empty object. (If the attributes argument is omitted, then Pablo('rect') will _select_ all `<rect>` elements already present in the document).

Typically, elements are instead created with an [element shortcut method](/api/#creation).
